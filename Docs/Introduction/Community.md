# [Documentation](../README.md) / [Introduction](README.md) / Community

Feel free to join in the [StaxRip Community on Discord](https://discord.gg/uz8pVR79Bd),
where you can chat and share knowledge with other StaxRip users and the devs, or rather me. 
This is the way to go if you have questions regarding settings, usage, recommendations, etc.,
you want just to be up to date.


Usage questions can also be asked on the *StaxRip threads* on

- [VideoHelp](https://forum.videohelp.com/threads/369913-StaxRip-support-thread)
- [Doom9](https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=172068)

although no developer or contributor is active there anymore.
