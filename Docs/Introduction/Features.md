# [Documentation](../README.md) / [Introduction](README.md) / Features

## General
- Support for a wide variety of formats and tools.
- Batch Processing, can not only be used for encoding but for any task like remuxing,
  demuxing or AviSynth+/VapourSynth script generation.
- Cut/Trim feature, for MKV output it works even in Copy/Mux mode, no re-encoding required.
- Minimal user interaction required due to rich configuration and automation features.
- Macro system to be used in scripts and command lines, this enables a design that allows
  to change any setting at any time which is much more flexible and powerful than a design
  that requires to perform one step after another.
- The job list can be processed with multiple StaxRip instances in parallel for maximum performance using modern CPUs.
- Video and multiple audio tracks can be processed in parallel for maximum performance with modern hardware.
- Support for an unlimited amount of audio and subtitle tracks.
- Automatic and manual update check.
- Powerful media info using the media info frontend MediaInfo.NET
  which includes a folder view to show media info for a folder in a grid view.
- Powerful media preview using the media player mpv.net.
- Support via Discord and Issue Tracker.
- Easy to use and feature rich crop dialog with hardware acceleration.
- Powerful resize and aspect ratio related features with auto-detection.
- Thumbnail generation tools.
- Full access and control to underlying tools with full support for
  command line and script editing to leverage the full potential of the tools.
- Container and hard-coded subtitles.
- Clean and easy to read log file and dedicated log file viewer to easily navigate the processing steps.
- Video comparison tool to compare video frames in a tab view.
- The processing window can be minimized to the system tray.
- For all essential console tools such as x265 and mkvmerge there is a built-in command line preview
  either directly integrated in the dialog or via menu accessible.


## Tool Management
- Powerful tool management dialog.
- Over 200 tools included.
- Tools are searchable.
- Custom paths can be defined or removed.
- Custom paths can be defined using the powerful search and index tool voidtools Everything.
- Tool overview either as CSV file opened in (MS) Office or using PowerShell Out-GridView
  which supports a powerful search and filter feature.
- Feature to open the folder of a tool or start the tool including console tools showing the help.


## Help
- For every tool the help file or help page can be shown in the
  Apps management dialog and also in the main menu under Help.
- The Apps management dialog provides easy access to tool websites and download sites.
- Tooltips by mouse hover, right-click and Ctrl+right-click.
- Context help via right-click, for x264 and x265 the context help has a local and an online version,
  for all video encoders the console output help can be shown via context help and with console look and feel.
- Customizable assistant messages.


## Preprocessing
- Preprocessing steps such as demuxing is fully customizable with custom command lines.
- Demuxers: mkvextract, MP4Box, ffmpeg, eac3to.
- Demuxing GUI for mkvextract, MP4Box, ffmpeg and eac3to to define which tracks should be demuxed.
- Automatic demuxing mode to automatically demux everything.
- Automatic indexing with DGIndex, DGIndexNV, ffms2 and L-Smash-Works.
- Support for opening ISO images natively.


## Projects, Templates, Profiles
- AviSynth+ and VapourSynth video filter plugins that are not
  included can be used by adding custom filter profiles.
- Customizable video filter profiles that can be enabled via context menu.
- Project system that automatically saves encoding settings for a particular source file.
- Previously encoded projects can be found in a Recent menu to encode them again
  with different settings, encoded audio and video of previous runs can be reused or overwritten.
- Project templates for different types of sources, a startup template
  can be defined to customize the startup settings.
- Profile system for video filter profiles, video encoder profiles, audio encoding profiles,
  muxing profiles, filter setup (full script) profiles.
- Project options used by projects and project templates and also separate global settings.


## Video Processing
- Video editing using classic AviSynth+ and VapourSynth, both equally well-supported
  and everything like QTGMC just works out of the box effortlessly.
- Large amount of included AviSynth+ and VapourSynth plugins, overall around 200 tools included.
- Code editor to enable full control over AviSynth+ and VapourSynth,
  everything that is possible with AviSynth+ and VapourSynth is also possible with StaxRip.
- Code preview to preview the code generated for AviSynth+ and VapourSynth.
- Built-in hardware accelerated video preview and preview via mpv.net.
- Built-in script info to show script parameters like frame rate and
  advanced script preview using various external tools like AVSMeter.
- External AviSynth+ (.avs) and VapourSynth (.vpy) scripts can be opened/imported.
- Auto crop.
- Full high bit depth and HDR support.
- Automatic import of (VUI) color metadata.
- Automatic extraction and import of HDR10+ and Dolby Vision metadata.
- Compressibility check.
- It can be customized which source filters should be used for different formats.
- Unicode support for AviSynth+ on Windows 10.


## Encoding
- Hardware encoding for AMD, Intel and NVIDIA.
- All classic and modern video encoders are fully supported: x264, x265, AomEnc, Rav1e, SVT-AV1(-PSY), NVEncC, QSVEncC, VCEEnvC, Xvid, ffmpeg.
- Audio encoders: eac3to, qaac, fdkaac, opusenc, DeeZy/DEE, ffmpeg.
- Popular encoders such as x265 and NVEnc have almost 100% GUI support
  meaning almost all available command line switches are supported.
- Video encoder dialogs are searchable to quickly find options in a drop-down and search field.
- Video encoder dialogs have a command line preview, this preview has a context
  menu that allows to quickly find GUI options for command line switches.
- Generic audio and video command line based encoder to integrate any encoder that isn't already built-in.
- Parallel audio/video encoding.
- Parallel chunk encoding for various video encoders.


## Muxing
- MKV output using mkvmerge.
- MP4 output using MP4Box.
- ffmpeg supporting various container formats.
- Copy/Mux modes for audio and video plain remuxing without encoding.
- Cut/Trim feature for MKV output that works even in Copy/Mux mode, no re-encoding required.


## Power User
- Event Command feature that allows to assign custom commands to various events
  for instance to execute custom command lines on given events.
- Scriptable via PowerShell.
- Customizable main menu and context menus.
- Long path support, if enabled in Windows 10 file paths can be longer than 260 characters.
- A PowerShell terminal can be shown with support for the new Windows Terminal,
