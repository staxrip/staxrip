## About StaxRip

StaxRip is a powerful and customizable video/audio encoding GUI for Windows.  
It executes and controls console apps such as x265, mkvmerge, ffmpeg, etc. and uses scripting based frame servers,
AviSynth+ and VapourSynth, for video processing. Each project can also be extended by various events and settings.

StaxRip places great emphasis on automation, but still offers a full range of functions with
extensive manual intervention options for advanced users. Because StaxRip uses native encoders and other command line tools,
you can always check and reproduce different steps. A log file, that logs all executions and their output, helps you.

***StaxRip is no One-Click Encoder!***  
StaxRip is capable of performing a wide variety of jobs for video/audio processing.
To unleash its full power, users are required to know what they want to achieve and how to set up StaxRip to meet their needs.  

If you are a first-time user, it is especially strongly recommended that you learn the basics referring to the documents
and do some tests to understand how StaxRip works and what you can achieve with it.
A good way to start is [First Start](../Usage/First-Start.md).

However, StaxRip also provides an [Assistant](../Usage/User-Interface/Main/Assistant.md) feature that
will guide you through your jobs step by step so that you can start more easily and prevent mistakes.

There are a lot of resources in StaxRip-related [communities](Community.md).
Users are encouraged to visit those [communities](Community.md) for help and more information.

## Target Group

Everyone, who wants to encode videos safely and in a controlled and transparent way and who is not afraid to
invest some time in getting to know StaxRip, testing things out, reading the documentation and asking questions if necessary.
