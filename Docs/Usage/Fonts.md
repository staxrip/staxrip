# [Documentation](../README.md) / [Usage](README.md) / Fonts

Since `v2.48` StaxRip comes with its own fonts, from which you can choose. As of now you can select between fonts
for default texts as well as for fonts for code type presentations like encoder parameters. This gives you the
possibility to improve the readability and/or reduce the needed space by texts, so more text fits a desired space.  
To change them go to: `Tools » Settings » User Interface`:

> [!TIP]
> You can also add you own fonts.  
> Make sure you use `.ttf` font files and put them into your Settings folder:
> - `.\Settings\Fonts\Code\` for *Code Fonts*
> - `.\Settings\Fonts\Default\` for *Defauls Fonts*
> 
> Folder hierarchy doesn't matter as all subfolders are included for searching.
