- **Save projects automatically**  
    Whenever a project is modified and an action is performed, that will close the current project, 
    StaxRip will ask you, if you want to save the latest changes so they don't get lost.
    With this option enabled StaxRip will automatically save the project and don't bother you.  
    :warning: ***They will always overwrite the last configuration, even if you just want to test something out. So be careful!***
