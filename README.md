# About

StaxRip is a powerful video/audio encoding GUI for Windows.  
It executes and controls console apps such as x265, mkvmerge, ffmpeg, etc. and uses scripting based frame servers, AviSynth+ and VapourSynth, for video processing.
Each project can also be extended by various events and settings.

***StaxRip is no One-Click Encoder!***  
StaxRip is capable of performing a wide variety of jobs for video/audio processing. To unleash its full power, users are required to know what they want to achieve and how to set up StaxRip to meet their needs.
If you are a first-time user, it is especially strongly recommended that you learn the basics referring to the documents and do some tests to understand how StaxRip works and what you can achieve with it. However, StaxRip also provides an 'Assistant' feature that will guide you through your jobs step by step so that you can start more easily and prevent mistakes.

There are a lot of resources in StaxRip-related communities. Users are strongly encouraged to visit those communities for help and more information.

# Prerequirements
- OS limitations: **Windows 7** users can use StaxRip only partly. The following tools are included and don't have official **Windows 7** support anymore. You in case you don't want to upgrade your system, you can replace these tools with an older, compatible, version, which should work, but of course with some limited usability:
    - MKVToolNix
        - Latest working version is reported to be `v64.0`. Last (complete) working StaxRip version is *StaxRip v2.10.0 (2021-10-06)* including *MKVToolNix v61.0*
        - Nevertheless `mkvtoolnix-64-bit-68.0.0-revision-001-g6a55c58d2` is reported to work, you can download it here: https://mkvtoolnix.download/windows/continuous/64-bit/68.0.0/
    - Python
        - Needed for VapourSynth. Last **Windows 7** compatible version was used in *StaxRip v2.25.0 (2023-08-02)*. As of now using VapourSynth R63 it could be possible to downgrade Python to `v3.8.*`that is **Windows 7** compatible, but requires experienced users.
             
     Alternatively you can download an old StaxRip release, but then you don't benefit from new functions and bug fixes.

- Some tools and filters might need a specific version of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes. Due to the frequent changing and replacing of tools and filters, it is impossible to provide precise details about the right dependency. So if you get error messages to due to missing runtime files, we recommend to download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Runtimes from:
    - https://github.com/abbodi1406/vcredist/releases
    - https://www.techpowerup.com/download/visual-c-redistributable-runtime-package-all-in-one

# Extraction / Usage

StaxRip is a portable application, so almost everything it needs is already included. 
This also means, that StaxRip does not have to (and cannot) be installed. 
You simply extract the [given archive](https://github.com/staxrip/staxrip/releases/latest) and when you start, StaxRip asks you where to store the settings.

It is recommended to choose the first option, which creates a subfolder in the existing startup folder where `StaxRip.exe` is in that you start.
This ensures, that you start with fresh/new settings as the settings of different versions could be imcompatible with each other,
which can lead to unwanted side effects like missing functionality or changing encoder parameters. 
It is also **very important** to **not** run existing jobs on a different StaxRip version as some encoder parameters could have been changed
and mess up the values. This is pretty rare, but it can happen.

Since `v2.37.0` the versioning has changed a little bit.  
Releases with the same second number (for example `v2.39.0`, `v2.39.2` and `v2.39.3`) are basically compatible with each other,
means that you can overwrite the existing files of your old instance and use the same/old settings.
Whenever this is possible an `UPDATE` archive is also released so you can just download the files that are needed to overwrite.
