- Removed the Character Limit on the Temp Folders. It will not longer create the '...' after it hits 30 characters Which was designed for Windows 260 limit(Mainly for older Windows). If you need more then 260 characters you can alter the GroupPolicy Settings which will allow your to bypass the limit.
- Added MKVinfo App to menu to check colorspace coordinates (Which Mediainfo no longer displays), This is useful for HDR content to make sure metadate has the correct HDR metadata.
